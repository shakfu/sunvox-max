# sunvox-max

Towards an Max/MSP external which embeds the [sunvox](https://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/sunvox_lib.php) engine.




## Status

Test outputs correct but crappy audio output which is probably due to incorrect audio processing (interleaving?)

## Usage


To test (only macOS):

```bash
make setup
make
make sign
```
